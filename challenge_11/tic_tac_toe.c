 * Written for challenges in course:
 *   https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/
 * Requirements:
 * * write a program that plays tic-tac-toe
 *   * game Is played on a 3x3 grid the game Is played by two players, who take
 *     turns
 * * Create an array to represent the board
 *   * can be of type char and consist of 10 elements (do not use zero)
 *   * each element represents a coordinate on the board that the user can
 *     select
 * * Some functions that you should probably create
 *   * checkForWin - checks to see If a player has won or the game Is a draw
 *   * drawboard â€” redraws the board for each player turn
 *   * markBoard - sets the char array with a selection and check for an invalid
 *     selection
